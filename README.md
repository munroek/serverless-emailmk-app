# Serverless Email Marketing Application

## Project Description

Welcome to the Serverless Email Marketing Application project! This repository contains the code and resources needed to build a scalable, cost-efficient, and highly reliable email marketing solution using AWS services. The application leverages AWS Simple Email Service (SES), EventBridge, S3, Lambda, and Identity & Access Management (IAM) to deliver a seamless email marketing experience without the need for managing servers.

### Features

- **Automated Email Campaigns**: Schedule and send promotional emails to your subscribers using AWS SES and EventBridge.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilize AWS EventBridge to trigger email sending based on specific events or schedules.
- **Scalable Storage**: Store email templates, logs, and other related data in AWS S3.
- **Serverless Computing**: Use AWS Lambda for processing email requests, managing templates, and handling other backend logic.
- **Secure Access Management**: Implement robust security and access control using AWS IAM roles and policies.

### AWS Services Utilized

1. **AWS Simple Email Service (SES)**:
   - Used for sending transactional and marketing emails.
   - Provides high deliverability rates and scalability.

2. **AWS EventBridge**:
   - Manages event routing to Lambda functions.
   - Enables scheduling of email campaigns and handling of custom events.

3. **AWS S3**:
   - Stores email templates, campaign data, and logs.
   - Ensures durable and scalable storage for all assets.

4. **AWS Lambda**:
   - Handles email processing, template management, and event handling.
   - Executes code in a serverless environment, scaling automatically with demand.

5. **AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)**:
   - Secures the application with fine-grained access control.
   - Manages permissions for SES, S3, Lambda, and EventBridge interactions.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with access to SES, EventBridge, S3, Lambda, and IAM.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and serverless architecture.


### Usage

1. **Configure SES**: Verify email addresses and set up your domain in AWS SES.
2. **Create S3 Buckets**: Set up S3 buckets for storing templates and logs.
3. **Define EventBridge Rules**: Create rules for triggering email campaigns.
4. **Deploy Lambda Functions**: Ensure Lambda functions are properly configured and deployed.
5. **Set IAM Policies**: Apply necessary IAM roles and policies for secure access.
